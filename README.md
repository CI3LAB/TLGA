Data and codes for "Two-list genetic algorithm for optimizing work package schemes to minimize project costs"

Optimizing work package schemes is challenging under uncertain task duration. This paper develops a two-list genetic algorithm (TLGA) to optimize work package schemes with minimal project costs under deterministic and stochastic task durations. First, this paper defines the deterministic and stochastic work package scheme problem. Second, the TLGA, comprising a task and a work packaging list, is developed to generate the deterministic work package scheme and issue work package policies through stochastic distribution simulations.
